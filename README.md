# SpaceX Launch Data Collection using REST API

This repository contains the completed notebook for the **"Data Collection API Lab"**, a peer-graded assignment in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The objective of this lab is to extract, parse, and structure real-world data from the public SpaceX REST API using Python.

## Project Description

The goal of this lab is to retrieve SpaceX launch data via a public API, extract relevant information using Python, and convert unstructured JSON responses into clean, tabular datasets suitable for analysis.

Key tasks include:
- Accessing and querying RESTful APIs using the `requests` library
- Parsing nested JSON structures
- Converting extracted data into pandas DataFrames
- Saving structured data for downstream data analysis
